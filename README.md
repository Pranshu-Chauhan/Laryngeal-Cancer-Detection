## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of three different approaches for detecting laryngeal cancer using deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project can be accessed [here](https://zenodo.org/records/1003200). The three approaches include:

1. Neural Network Approach
2. Ensemble Learning Approach
3. DenseNet201-based Approach

Each approach includes detailed preprocessing steps, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Zenodo: [Laryngeal Cancer Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/1003200). It includes images of laryngeal tissue classified into four categories: Healthy (He), Hypertrophic Vessels (Hbv), Leukoplakia (Le), and Intrapapillary Capillary Loops (IPCL).

## Approach 1: Neural Network Approach

### Preprocessing

1. Load the dataset.
2. Apply Median Filter followed by Gaussian Filter to remove noise from the images.
3. Display some images before and after filtering.

### Feature Extraction

- Features extracted from four pre-trained CNN models: VGG, Inception, DenseNet, and EfficientNet.
- Total extracted features: 46,976.
- Top 200 features selected for training.

### Model Training

- Neural network with 6 layers (5 dense layers and 1 SoftMax layer).
- Batch normalization and dropout techniques applied.
- Model tuning for optimal performance.

### Results

- Achieved an accuracy of 99.1%.
- Classification summary and confusion matrix are provided.

## Approach 2: Ensemble Learning Approach

### Preprocessing

1. Load the dataset.
2. Apply Median Filter followed by Gaussian Filter to remove noise from the images.
3. Display some images before and after filtering.

### Feature Extraction

- Features extracted from four pre-trained CNN models: VGG, Inception, DenseNet, and EfficientNet.
- Total extracted features: 46,976.

### Base Models Training

- Train Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, and K-Neighbors Classifier.
- Stack predictions for the train and test sets.

### Meta Classifier

- Logistic regression used as the meta classifier on the stacked features.

### Results

- Achieved an accuracy of 99.24%.
- Classification summary and confusion matrix are provided.

## Approach 3: DenseNet201

### Preprocessing
- Load the dataset.
- Apply Median Filter followed by Gaussian Filter to remove noise from the images.
- Display some images before and after filtering.

### Base Models Training
- Import the DenseNet201 model and drop the inbuilt last classification layer.
- Add additional layers:
   - Average Max Pooling layer
   - Dense layer with 1024 neurons
   - Fully connected SoftMax layer with 4 neurons for the final 4 classifications
- Unfreeze the last 5 layers for weight updates during training.
- Train the model using StratifiedKFold cross-validation.

### Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 99.42%.
- Classification summary and confusion matrix are provided.

## Additional Experiments

- CLAHE Technique + NN-Approach: Accuracy 90%
- Gamma Correction + NN-Approach: Accuracy 97%
- Image Sharpening + NN-Approach: Accuracy 96%
- NN-Approach without feature selection: Accuracy 98.8%
- Feature Extraction using Local Binary Pattern + STAT features + DenseNet Features: Accuracy 96%
- Recursive Feature Elimination using Random Forest was computationally expensive and not implemented.

| Gamma Correction + NN Approach   | 97           |
| Image Sharpening Technique + NN Approach | 96   |
| NN Approach without Feature Selection | 98.8  |
| Feature Extraction (LBP + STAT + DenseNet) | 96 |
| Recursive Feature Elimination    | Not implemented |
